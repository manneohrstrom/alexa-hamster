She kept the fried candy in her sock.
He closed the lid and skipped away.
As a baby, he liked to be carried.

The trousers didn't make a sound.
He was in the shower with a frown.
I was allowed an amount of candy every day.
I was told the children had a cold.

I was happier than ever.
I copied the happiest boy.
I cried when they replied.

She dried the paper in the photo copier.

You are nicer than a shiny angel.
My writing is about shining things.

He dropped snot because he had a runny nose.
He patted a humming goat.
There were bird droppings on the steps.
