the bus was full
yes, i am back
I think about chips
the kitchen was long
well you are my pal
pull back the chick
catch that rich cat
turn it off
less cake for mum
a puff of smoke
i am full of candy
a magic stick
he jumped over the bank
hunting in the woods
buzzing bees
a blue candy cracker
honk and wink and sing!
i have a long bunk bed.
fish and chips
not much cake
such a good boy!
fetch the dragon!
