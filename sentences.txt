the bus was full
yes, i am back
I think about chips
the kitchen was long
well you are my pal
pull back the chick
catch that rich cat
turn it off
less cake for mum
a puff of smoke
i am full of candy
a magic stick
he jumped over the bank
hunting in the woods
buzzing bees
a blue candy cracker
honk and wink and sing!
i have a long bunk bed.
fish and chips
not much cake
such a good boy!
fetch the dragon!
I will wait for the train.
have you paid with a coin?
a cold london rain
i am afraid of stupid finn
finn is made out of oil
i will join the fun
i point at soil
i will stay to play today
the toy went away
a royal boy
will you enjoy or annoy?
today i will play says the hamster
go away! don't take my toy!
the goal is to go play in the snow
oh no, my toe is so cold!
coach him to score a goal
today, the snow will grow
